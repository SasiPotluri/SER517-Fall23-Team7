## Aerial Object Detection for Search and  Rescue


### Project Description

#### Overview:

The project aims to implement video-based object detection and recognition for aerial search and rescue, specifically designed to run on Kutta's Small Mission Computer (SMC).

#### Motivation:

The motivation behind this project is to harness the potential of open-source AI/ML technology to improve the success of Search and Rescue missions, aligning with Kutta's mission to "Make the World Safer!"

#### Collaborators:

-   Kutta Technologies
-   Ira Fulton School of Engineering - Software Engineering - ASU (Arizona State University) 


### Team Members

-   Nihal
-   Sasikanth
-   Virinchi
-   Mythri

### Algorithm Selection

The chosen algorithm for object detection is DETr (Data-efficient Image Transformer). DETr is a state-of-the-art object detection model that has shown promising results in various computer vision tasks.

### Task Division



### Project Phases

#### Phase 1 Tasks Accomplished:

-   Setup the Small Machine Computer the client provided and Installed the required packaged and technologies based on the project requirements. This involved physically configuring and preparing the small machine computer provided by the client for use in your project. Like connecting the hardware, such as plugging in cables.
-   Researched on PuTTy, which is an SSH Client for Windows and established the same on SMC.
-   Integrated Sci-Kit on SMC and enabled DHCP on Eth0.

- Decided on the Machine Learning Object Detection Algorithm to be implemented which is DETR (End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers). This involved identifying and documenting the data requirements for training the machine learning model, specifically the DETR model. It included understanding what type of data is needed, how much data is required, and the format or quality standards for the data.

### Required Skills

-   Proficiency in machine learning and computer vision
-   Familiarity with DETr algorithm
-   Programming skills for software porting and optimization
-   Knowledge of GPU programming (OpenCL).
-   Experience with aerial image analysis.
